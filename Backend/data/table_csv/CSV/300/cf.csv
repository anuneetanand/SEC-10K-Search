Those conditions included the inability to obtain significant conversions of Venezuelan bolivars related to intercompany U.S. dollar denominated accounts, an evaluation of the effects of the implementation of a fourth-quarter 2015 operational restructuring, resulting in a 36% reduction in our labor force in Venezuela, and our expectation of the changes in Venezuela’s responses to changes in its economy.
