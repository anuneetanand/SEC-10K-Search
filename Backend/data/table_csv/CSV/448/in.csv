"[1] See Note 2—Visa Europe. [2] Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Earnings per share is calculated based on unrounded numbers. The number of shares and per share amounts for the prior periods presented have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the four-for-one stock split effected in the second quarter of fiscal 2015. See Note 13—Stockholders' Equity. [3] Net income is allocated based on proportional ownership on an as-converted basis. The weighted-average number of shares of as-converted class B common stock used in the income allocation was 405 million for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015. The weighted-average number of shares of as-converted class C common stock used in the income allocation was 58 million, 75 million and 87 million for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The weighted-average number of shares of preferred stock, included within participating securities, was 33 million of as-converted UK&I preferred stock, and 44 million of as-converted Europe preferred stock for fiscal 2017. [4] Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding are calculated on an as-converted basis, and include incremental common stock equivalents, as calculated under the treasury stock method. The computation includes 5 million common stock equivalents for fiscal 2017 and 2016 and 6 million common stock equivalents for fiscal 2015, because their effect would have been dilutive. The computation excludes 2 million of common stock equivalents for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. [5] Participating securities include preferred stock outstanding and unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents, such as the Company's UK&I and Europe preferred stock, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and earned performance-based shares. UK&I and Europe preferred stock were issued as part of the purchase price consideration in connection with the Visa Europe acquisition and are convertible into a number of shares of class A common stock or class A equivalent preferred stock upon certain conditions. Participating securities' income is allocated based on the weighted-average number of shares of as-converted stock.
