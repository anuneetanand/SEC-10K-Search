[5] In 2015, represents a foreign currency loss related to conditions in Venezuela during 2015, that had us resolve that our Venezuelan bolivar-denominated net monetary assets that are subject to revaluation were no longer expected to be settled at the Venezuelan government CENCOEX official rate of 6.30, but rather at the then SIMADI rate of 200, the lowest official rate. Those conditions included the inability to obtain significant conversions of Venezuelan bolivars related to intercompany U.S. dollar denominated accounts, an evaluation of the effects of the implementation of a fourth-quarter 2015 operational restructuring, resulting in a 36% reduction in our labor force in Venezuela, and our expectation of the changes in Venezuela’s responses to changes in its economy. [6] In 2016, primarily includes amounts to resolve a Multi-District Litigation relating to Celebrex and Bextra pending against the Company in New York federal court for $486 million, partially offset by the reversal of a legal accrual where a loss is no longer deemed probable. For additional information, see Note 17A5. In addition, 2016 includes a settlement related to a patent matter. In 2015, primarily includes $784.6 million related to an agreement in principle reached in February 2016 and finalized in April 2016 to resolve claims alleging that Wyeth's practices relating to the calculation of Medicaid rebates for its drug, Protonix (pantoprazole sodium), between 2001 and 2006, several years before Pfizer acquired Wyeth in 2009, violated the Federal Civil False Claims Act and other laws. For additional information, see Note 17A5. In 2014, primarily includes approximately $610 million for Neurontin-related matters (including off-label promotion actions and antitrust actions), $400 million to resolve a securities class action against Pfizer in New York federal court, and approximately $56 million for an Effexor-related matter, partially offset by $130 million of income from the reversal of two legal accruals where a loss is no longer deemed probable. [7] In 2016, represents a charge related to the write-down of the HIS net assets to fair value less estimated costs to sell. See Note 2B for additional information. [8] Amounts reflect the adoption of a new accounting standard that requires that cash flows present (i) excess tax benefits as operating activities, rather than financing activities on a prospective basis beginning in the year of adoption, and (ii) cash paid by us when directly withholding shares for tax-withholding purposes as a cash outflow from financing activities, rather than operating activities and is reflected in the year of adoption and retrospectively in 2015 and 2014 (see Note 1B).
