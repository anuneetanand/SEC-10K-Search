Beverage revenue from company-owned bottlers, which primarily includes our consolidated bottling operations in our NAB and ESSA segments, is approximately 40% of our consolidated net revenue. Generally, our finished goods beverage operations produce higher net revenue, but lower operating margins as compared to concentrate sold to authorized bottling partners for the manufacture of finished goods beverages.
