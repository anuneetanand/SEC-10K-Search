"[1] Amounts may not add due to rounding. [2] Amounts may not add due to rounding. [3] The change from December 31, 2016 reflects the build of inventory primarily for and in advance of new or potential product launches and increases to meet targeted levels for certain products in the normal course of business, as well as an increase due to foreign exchange. [4] The increase in total property, plant and equipment is primarily due to capital additions and the impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by depreciation, reductions due to restructuring efforts and disposals. [5] The decrease in Identifiable intangible assets, less accumulated amortization, is primarily due to (i) amortization, (ii) measurement period adjustments related to Medivation (see Note 2A), as well as (iii) impairments of Developed technology rights (see Note 4), partially offset by (iv) assets acquired as part of the acquisition of AstraZeneca’s small molecule anti-infectives business (see Note 2A), (v) the assets recorded in connection with the EU and U.S. approvals of Besponsa and in connection with the U.S. approval of Bosulif (see Note 7E) and (vi) the assets recorded in connection with the approvals of Bavencio (see Note 2C).
